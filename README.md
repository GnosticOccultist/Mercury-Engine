## Mercury-Engine

Mercury-Engine is a 3D game engine, which is still in very early development. It is designed to implement
the bedrock of any game or application for you (graphics, assets, scenegraph,...), while still being 
highly flexible for expert programmers.

The engine uses OpenGL as the graphics API, but others may come in the future!

## Features

Most of the features aren't implemented yet or are still in development stage...

- __OpenGL Objects Wrapper__:

    Each OpenGL objects are designed inside a wrapper class, which provides helpful function
to upload, create, store or cleanup data. You can use them to create your own rendering process, without messing
with the very low-level of graphics API. (Note: Not every OpenGL objects are implemented yet!)
